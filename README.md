# Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard – Power BI

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyze Blinkit’s retail sales performance across outlet formats, product categories, and location tiers.

The objective was to transform raw transactional data into a business-ready analytical solution that enables stakeholders to quickly identify revenue drivers, evaluate outlet performance, and understand customer purchase patterns.

The dashboard provides a consolidated performance view with:
* Total Sales: $1.20M
* Total Items: 8,523
* Average Sales per Item: $140.99
* Average Rating: 3.92
  
## Business Objectives
The solution was designed to:

* Identify the outlet formats contributing the highest revenue
* Analyze sales distribution across location tiers and outlet sizes
* Understand category-level demand
* Track the long-term impact of outlet establishment on sales performance
* Enable dynamic filtering for faster decision-making
